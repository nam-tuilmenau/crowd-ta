# The Crowd Thinks Aloud: Crowdsourcing the Thinking Aloud Method in Usability Testing

This repository contains relevant data for a user study conducted to compare a traditional synchronous remote concurrent TA to a proposed asynchronous crowdsourced concurrent TA regarding the quality and quantity of identified usability problems and participants' performance.

This repository contains three folders:
* *Source_code*: it contains the source code of the developed platform that enabled the conduction of the crowdsourced TA.
* *Test_Instructions_and_Tasks*: it contains the instructions employed in the crowdsourced TA, the scripts followed in the traditional sessions, and the information of the tasks employed in both cases.
* *Training_Videos*: it includes the demonstration videos employed to train participants on how to TA in both setups.
